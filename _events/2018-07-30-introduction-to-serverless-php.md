  Welcome to brumPHP August! This month we have Rob Allen talking us through Serverless.

  This month we've got one free ticket to give away at the start of the event to attend Symfony's annual UK Conference in London on September 27-28, as well as the usual free Jetbrains license.

  We are also currently pioneering live streaming of the event, plus archiving the talk for playback, courtesy of Civico's Birmingham-based streaming platform. You can access the link and archives at http://civico.net/brumtech.

  We have drinks and pizza courtesy of Jump24 (https://www.jump24.co.uk) and a ticket to Hackference Brum to give away, so hope to see you there!
