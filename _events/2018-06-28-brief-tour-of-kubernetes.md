    This month we have Max Woolf talk on one of the main container orchestration tools at the DevOps engineers' disposal: Kubernetes.

    We'll scratch the surface of Kubernetes, how its various components work and how to control a cluster from the command line. We'll also touch on when it's a good idea to use Kubernetes, reasons for using it over more traditional methods of application deployment and discuss the pros and cons of various managed Kubernetes solutions.
