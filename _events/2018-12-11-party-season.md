  This month we're all tired from a year of events, so we're taking a month off and raising a glass with brumJS at Cosy Club on Bennett's Hill!
  We have a room reserved, so make your way from 7pm to 33 Bennett's Hill for a buffet and drinks!
  We won't be filming this event, so that should ease everyone's minds!
