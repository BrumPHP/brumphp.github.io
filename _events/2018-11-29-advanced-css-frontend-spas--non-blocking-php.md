description: >
  This month we have two talks covering advanced CSS to strip JavaScript logic out of SPAs and an introduction to non-blocking PHP tooling.
  We have a year Jetbrains license to give away as usual, plus drinks and food provided by Mortimer Spinks (https://www.mortimerspinks.com). We're grateful as ever to Talis (www.talis.com) for hosting us. We hope to see you there!

  Pandelis Zembashis : The Promise of Performance

  As a JavaScript developer I'm used to being able to easily fire off callbacks and wait for it to execute later without blocking the rest of my operations;
  We'll explore the options and tools available to us as PHP developers for building asynchronous non blocking APIs.

  About Me:
  Pandelis is a computer science student studying at Birmingham City University ðŸŒ§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, but is originally from ðŸŒžðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¾ He enjoys spending the weekends with little to no sleep making what he thinks are cool hacks at hackathons all around the UK and sometimes abroad. During the week he's also helping to build âœ¨beautiful WordPressâœ¨ powered event and ticketing ðŸŽŸ sites for arts and cultural venues ðŸŽ­ at Substrakt.

  Regilio Henry: An Introduction to Advanced CSS

  In this session, we'll build responsive dynamic complex (SPA) frontends (for all responsive viewports) without previous knowledge of CSS and without the need for JavaScript/CSS libraries (the traditional methods) using little code resulting in excellent performance and smaller memory footprints compared to the traditional method. All can be executed on modern browsers, and will lessen implementation times in the development lifecycle.

  About Me:
  Iâ€™m a freelance Backend Developer and Software Architect with a strong affiliation to R&D, mainly for the .NET platform.

  Among other things, Iâ€™ve built platforms for ABNAMRO and Moodyâ€™s in the Netherlands/Belgium.
