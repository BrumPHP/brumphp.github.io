  Happy 2019! You didn't think we'd stop, did you?

  Oh no, we've been busy. This year is half booked already, and we're off to a cracking start... we've got the usual license to give away, drinks and pizza. All are welcome - non PHP (neither of our talks are exclusively on PHP!) and non tech people alike!

  A quick shoutout to our new sponsor, Jump24 who have previously sponsored us - who are also looking for hires! https://www.indeed.co.uk/viewjob?t=senior+web+developer&jk=d1254ea2030d76d6&_ga=2.67172690.211107900.1547479314-1309266227.1547026504

  Quick Intro to Cryptography - Richard Wallman

  Cryptography is something we constantly use, whether we realise it or not, but it's a subtle and nuanced area. This will be a shallow skim rather than a deep dive on the subject, for those who can't tell their RSA from their elbow.

  The UX of Text - Stuart Langridge

  About bots, and how they shouldn't pretend to be humans. About how user experience is more than just user interface. About language, and how a word can be worth a thousand pictures. About le mot juste. About where we go next.
