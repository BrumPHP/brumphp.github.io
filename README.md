This is a Jekyll site so their documentation applies. For all of you developers with no access to their docs, you'll need ruby installed:

```sh
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
gem install jekyll bundler

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Build the site on the preview server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
